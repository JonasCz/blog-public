<p>Unfortunatley I don&rsquo;t have photos of everything, nor the buld process :-(</p>
<p>Components for the solar trailer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A heavy steel-framed, single wheel bike trailer (8.5kg for just the unmodified trailer), with a DIY fram to hold up the solar panels, made of aluminum square tubes, held together by 3D-printed spacer blocks, with by a bolt (with a big washer) through the spacer block and the square tube(s) to clamp it together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 100w flexible solar panels; two exposed while riding, with two more tucked underneath and deployable when stopped. 1.2kg each according to the manufacturer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 solar charge controller, from China, can be found by searching for <em>CTK-EV300</em> This is a &ldquo;boosting&rdquo; model, meaining it takes the lower voltage produced by the solar panels (~30v), and &ldquo;boosts&rdquo; it up to the ~50v required for charging the battery pack. More about that below</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And the bike I already had was a self-built eBike conversion with:</p>
<ul>
<li>TSDZ2 motor. more about that below, too.</li>
<li>Slightly tired 1000wh battery (48v)</li>
<li>Built on a Rockrider 540 bike (mid-range hardtail MTB). Front and rear racks additionally bodged on.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-build">The build</h1>
<p>It took quite a while to build this, the most time consuming part being the frame for the solar panels, since it took a lot of trial and error to get all the 3D printed connectors right and angled correctly.</p>
<p>I also designed a custom connector for the trailer to attach, since I didn&rsquo;t quite trust the fragile looking extended quick-release skewer the trailer came with. The custom connector design was a pair of &ldquo;split&rdquo; 3D printed blocks with space inside, modelled to fit precisely around the seatstays of the bike, those blocks then being clamped in place from either side with steel plates, and then the trailer hooking onto the steel plates (sorry, no photos for now..).</p>
<h1 id="test-trip">Test trip</h1>
<p>I did a 5 day trip to test this setup, in south-west france. Two days out, one rest day (aka lie-on-the-beach-and-do-nothing day), then two days back on the same route. I deliberately picked a week with near uninterrupted sunshine (this is important!), and a route that is nearly completely flat. The approximate route, resulting in aprroximately 160km per day:</p>

></p>
<p>Exclusively done using solar power, and only wild camping.</p>
<h1 id="what-worked">What worked</h1>
<p>Everything actually worked, and nothing broke! It gave me a significant daily range boost (making 160km feel like I&rsquo;ve only pedalled 60). With a bonus of not having to worry about phone or lights charging (provided from the main power system), and way more capacity for stuff in the trailer.</p>
<h1 id="the-limitations">The limitations:</h1>
<p>With the benefits, there&rsquo;s also some drawbacks:</p>
<h2 id="weather-dependency">Weather dependency:</h2>
<p>You think you&rsquo;re dependent on the weather with a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; bike touring set up? Well, you&rsquo;re even more dependent on the weather with this. For me it resulted in constantly looking at the weather forecast and the battery remaining percentage.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, even on perfect weather days, I needed to plan my riding around the sunshine hours, since the solar energy collected during riding is very low. This is due to the fact that even partial shade (from myself, surrounding trees, imperfect panel angle&hellip;) reduces the output of the panels significantly, and in addition, after brief partial shading of the panel, the charge controller takes a while to &ldquo;recover&rdquo; before it produces full charging power again. A more expensive controller (such as Genasun) may be better in this regard, but the limitation of shading is still there.</p>
<p>Additionally, while riding I only have 200w of solar panels exposed, whereas when stopped, I can unfold 200w more, thus having an even stronger incentive to stop and charge.</p>
<p>As a result, I planned my riding for a few hours in the early morning and evening, and then laying around during the sunny part of the day waiting for it to charge.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, the need for sunshine means that on cloudy days, there&rsquo;s no power. This thing was heavy and quite a slog to pedal without electric assist.</p>
<h2 id="day-to-day-limitations">Day to day limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s bigger and more cumbersome: meaning that some trails that I would have taken with just the bike now become unavailable. Not just rougher trails, but narrow gates (sheep barriers..), steps, even barriers on cycle paths become annoying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No trains with this: on a subsequent trip, there was an offer of all regional train tickets for 1â‚¬ in France, so I hopped on and did something completely different than what I&rsquo;d planned. Not possible with this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stuff-that-can-go-wrong">Stuff that can go wrong</h2>
<p>The motor I&rsquo;m using is known for not being particularly reliable, so I ended up taking a whole bag of parts, including a conventional crankset and installation tools to put on the bike in case the motor would fail in a way that left me without being able to pedal <strong>or</strong> use the electric assist, which is actually a possible failure mode of the TSDZ2. But I didn&rsquo;t need to use it.</p>
<p>If I were to put further work into a similar set-up, I&rsquo;d probably want to have a more reliable set-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More relaible motor; i.e. Bafang. I&rsquo;ve already had several failures with the TSDZ2 that required disassembly (heavy tools needed), and ordering parts from China (two week wait). But to make up for it, it feels really nice to ride, and there is <a class="link" href="https://github.com/OpenSourceEBike/TSDZ2_wiki/wiki"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >awesome custom firmware</a> that adds lots of nice features not available on anything else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dual motor, or dual-everything setup. It could be possible to add a hub motor to the trailer (a small e-scooter type wheel), plus two (smaller capacity) batteries, and two solar charge controllers. Both drive systems would operate simultaneously (batteries and chargers in paralell, motors maybe too?) With this, all electrical failure modes are covered, and it would be possible to switch over to the functioning drive system with only a minor reduction in performance in case of failure on one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, there&rsquo;s just more mechanical stuff to go wrong: trailer, trailer frame, one more wheel for punctures, more load and stress on the bike..</p>
<h1 id="the-conclusion">The conclusion</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably revisit this at some point (probably with a &ldquo;solar roof on a trike&rdquo; approach instead), and for now I&rsquo;m travelling on a conventional bike.</p>
